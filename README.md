Learn how to use Manim to depict math 

## Render a scene
In commind line: _manim -pql first_few_animations.py SquareToCircle_

This command tells manim exactly which Scene is to be rendered, 
in this case, it is SquareToCircle.  


This is necessary because a single scene file may contain more than one scene.  

Next, the flag -p tells manim to play the scene once itâ€™s rendered, 
and the -ql flag tells manim to render the scene in low quality. 

The -ql flag (for low quality, 480p15) can be replaced by the -qh flag, 
for high quality (1080p60). Can also add more flags, such as -s -ql or -s -qh. 
You can also add -qm, -qh, -qp and -qk for medium (1280x720 30FPS), high 
(1920x1080 60FPS), 2k (2560x1440 60FPS) and 4k quality (3840x2160 60FPS), 
respectively.  

If your file contains multiple Scene classes, and you want to render them 
all, you can use the -a flag.       

The -p flag plays the animation once it is rendered. If you want to open the 
file browser at the location of the animation instead of playing it, you can 
use the -f flag. You can also omit these two flags.  
### Save the last frame
Adding the flag -s tells manim to save the last frame of the scene.   
Saved frames can be found in themedia/images/first_few_animations folder.

### Save Gif
Finally, by default manim will output .mp4 files. If you want your 
animations in .gif format instead, use the --format gif flag. The output 
files will be in the same folder as the .mp4 files, and with the same name, 
but a different file extension.    

### Building Blocks of Manim
manim puts at your disposal three different concepts that you can 
orchestrate together to produce mathematical animations: the mathematical 
object (or mobject for short), the animation, and the scene.   

Animations are procedures that interpolate between two mobjects. Any 
property of a mobject that can be changed can be animated.
